Charted for Flutter
==============================

Charted for Flutter provides
* Visualization utilities ported from D3.js (Only the core utilities for rendering cartesian charts now).
* An easy-to-use API to create charts with animation and event handling.  (animation and event handling to be implented.)
* An interactive demo with cartesian charts and control to manipulate the data and orientation of the chart.

## To be implemented
Legend, event handling, animation, rotation and ellipses of axis ticks labels, addition chart behaviors and data transformers.

## Set up
Make sure the root of flutter_chart is a sibling folder with the flutter folder in order for the flutter dependency to resolve properly.

## Get started with the interactive demo
Get started with Charted for Flutter by trying out the example under lib/examples, run it from the Atom editor or use "flutter run" in corresponding folders.
